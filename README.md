# The Optimalest Salad

One day I was down in the cafeteria, looking at all the different ingredients
for salads. I thought to myself, why am I thinking about this. Then,
my less cynical decided that this might be an interesting python project.

### The Idea
Most salad bars I have seen charge by weight. What constitutes that weight is entierly up to you. You can two pounds of french dressing if that is what your heart desires (*Disclaimer: I am not a doctor but I do feel confident saying that no heart can handle 2 lbs of straight french dressing*).

So lets say that I want to build a salad that is 2.5 lbs and I want that salad to include the following: kale, olives, carrots, grilled chicken, bleu cheese dressing, and red onion. My goal is to answer the question: Which combination of these ingredients that sum to a mass of 2.5 lbs will result in the most nutritionally optimal salad?

Again, some disclaimers, I do not pretend to be a nutritionist. But with the help of the USDA Nutritional Database, I was able to track down the basic nutritional compositions of the most common salad ingredients.

### The Goal

The goal of this app will be to allow the user to input their desired price (ie. weight through $/lbs) and the ingredients that they want in their salad that day. Then, the app will determine the weight compostition of each of those ingredients that maximize "the good stuff" and minimize "the bad stuff".
